# Capital One Software Engineering Summit Challenge

This is my entry for the 2019 Capital One Software Engineering Summit Challenge. The goal of this challenge was to use the National Park Service API, as well as any other public APIs needed, and build a deployable web app that would allow users to have the best National Park experience possible with an intuitive, easy to navigate interface.

# What I Gained From The Challenge
- I learned how to code in JavaScript and how to work with JavaScript Object Notation ( JSON ) while processing the data from the National Park Service API.
- I gained enormous knowledge on how to use and deprive information from APIs.
- My HTML and CSS skills were honed and put to work while building the web application.

# Current Park Pages Fully Deployed

Due to the time I spent learning and understanding how to use the NPS API and JSON, I unfortunately was not able to fully deploy all the park pages to their full status which included : displaying alerts, articles, events, news releases, and visitor center information from a selected park.
